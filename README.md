# Data Processing

This respository first started off as solely a palce for me to store the notebooks that processed the performance data of my Raspberry Pi under 3 conditions.

1. Idle
2. Running PAFFT naked
3. Running PAFFT in a Docker container

The place where this original project is stored is in the Notebook, Raspberry Pi Performance. The input values for this are located in the zip file in Inputs. The Notebook should take care of unzipping these files.

A secondary thing that popped up in this repository was me playing around with the audio data that I recorded from the microphone I wired up to the raspberry pi. I used the notebook called Audio to both further my understanding of the fft as well as seeing how best to graph fft data.
